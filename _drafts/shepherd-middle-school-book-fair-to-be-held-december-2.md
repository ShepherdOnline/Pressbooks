SMS BOOK FAIR THIS WEEK! Shepherd Middle School is hosting the Scholastic Book Fair this week in the SMS counseling office. The Book Fair will be before school, during lunch/advisory, and after school all week long. Special late night sales will be Friday, December 2 after school until 6:30! Books make wonderful gifts and there is a great selection of books - fiction, non-fiction, art/coloring, comic/graphic novels, cookbooks and more! We also have perfect stocking stuffers- pencils, pens, erasers, and more! See you at the Book Fair!
