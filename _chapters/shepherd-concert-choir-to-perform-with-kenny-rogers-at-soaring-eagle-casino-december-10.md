The Shepherd High School Concert Choir will be performing with Kenny Rogers at the Soaring Eagle Casino on December 10. The Shepherd Choirs Facebook Page shared some additional information:
<blockquote>Kenny Rogers: The Gambler's Last Deal Christmas and Hits!<br style="clear: both;" />Rogers has sold more than 120 million albums worldwide. He has charted a record within each of the last seven decades. The first country artist to consistently sell out arenas, Rogers achieved pop superstardom as well — his 28 Billboard Adult Contemporary Top 10's rank him fourth-best of all time among men, trailing only Elton John, Neil Diamond, and Elvis Presley. Rogers has recorded 24 No. 1 hits, 12 No. 1 albums, 25 Top 10 country albums and is the RIAA’s eighth best-selling male solo artist of all time. The Country Music Hall of Fame member has received three GRAMMY® Awards, 11 People's Choice Awards, 19 American Music Awards, eight Academy of Country Music (ACM) Awards and six Country Music Association (CMA) Awards, among many other accolades.<br style="clear: both;" />For his upcoming Christmas &amp; Hits tour dates, Rogers will perform holiday favorites, selections from his 2015 Christmas album Once Again It’s Christmas and of course his well-known hits at concerts across the U.S.

Shepherd's own Concert Choir will be performing with the Gambler on his December 10th performance at Soaring Eagle Casino and Resort.
